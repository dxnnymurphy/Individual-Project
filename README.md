# Individual-Project
Air Quality Monitoring using Low-Cost Sensors around Southampton

This was a third year individual project from my time at University, the project involved using a range of low-cost sensors controlled by a Raspberry Pi to measure nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter levels around Southampton. This project used the Plantower PMS5003 sensor and a MICS6814 gas sensor and the data was compared that obtained from the council's own air quality monitoring site.

The script is a python script which was used to control the PMS5003 sensor using a UART interface, and also to read the ADC values corresponding to the readings of the MICS6814 sensor.
